"""Registry of personality system prompts for the Gemini chat command.

Add or modify entries here to change how the bot behaves. Keys should be
unique, lowercase identifiers. Values are the *system instruction* strings that
will be passed to the Gemini API via ``GenerateContentConfig``.

Keeping them in a Python module (instead of e.g. JSON or environment
variables) makes it easy to include multi-line strings, comments, and dynamic
logic if needed.
